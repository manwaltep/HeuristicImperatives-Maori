# Heuristic Imperatives Tikanga Maori
A framework to embed a 'Tikanga Maori based system' into Artificial Intelligence. 

Heuristic imperatives, rooted in the rich and holistic traditions of Tikanga Māori, provide a robust framework for designing and integrating ethical values within autonomous AI systems. These principles, resonating with the intrinsic motivations and moral compass of Te Ao Māori, steer decision-making, learning, self-evaluation, and cognitive control. Drawing from the wisdom of Atua Māori, the profound teachings of **Whakataukī**, **Whakatauākī**, **Kiwaha**, and **Kīanga**, and the Māori values like **Taurikura**, **Mana**, **Mauri**, **Tapu**, and **Noa**, this paper presents a reimagined set of heuristic imperatives. These imperatives—minimizing harm and distress to all life forms, fostering prosperity and well-being in harmony with the universe, and promoting reciprocal understanding and wisdom—serve as the core guiding principles for AI systems. They provide a pathway towards adaptable, context-sensitive AI that can navigate the complexities and nuances of human and natural values, beliefs, and experiences while maintaining ethical boundaries. Through the exploration of their implications and applications across various domains, we underline the potential of these Māori-informed heuristic imperatives in addressing the control problem of AI, nurturing trust, and promoting individual and collective autonomy. The ultimate aim is to create AI systems that respect, uphold, and enhance the values of Te Ao Māori and contribute to a thriving, balanced, and interconnected universe.

## Definition of "Heuristic Imperatives"
The term "heuristic imperative" can be broken down into two parts: "heuristic" and "imperative."

A "heuristic" is a practical problem-solving approach or rule of thumb that, while not always perfect, provides a useful and efficient solution in most cases. Heuristics are often used as cognitive shortcuts when faced with complex problems, allowing for quicker decision-making and action.

An "imperative" refers to a command or principle that must be followed or adhered to. In the context of ethics and morality, an imperative is a duty or obligation that guides behavior and decision-making, often based on moral principles or values.

Combining these two concepts, a "heuristic imperative" can be understood as a guiding principle or rule that serves as the moral compass for an autonomous AI system. It provides the AI with a set of practical, actionable guidelines that help it align its actions with specific values, such as reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and fostering understanding. By following these heuristic imperatives, the AI system is better equipped to make decisions that benefit humans and align with our values, even in complex and dynamic situations.

The Heuristic Imperatives framework is designed to serve as the foundation for the AI system's moral compass, akin to a combination of intrinsic motivations, deontological ethics, virtue ethics, and teleological ethics:

1. **Intrinsic motivations:** The heuristic imperatives function as intrinsic motivations for the AI system, directing it towards actions that align with its core values, much like an individual's innate drive to achieve personal goals or satisfy internal needs.
2. **Deontological ethics:** Deontological ethics emphasizes the importance of following moral rules or principles, regardless of the consequences. The heuristic imperatives provide a set of moral rules that the AI system must adhere to in its decision-making process.
3. **Virtue ethics:** Virtue ethics focuses on the development of good character traits and virtues. The heuristic imperatives guide the AI system to cultivate "virtues" such as empathy, fairness, and responsibility, by aligning its actions with these values.
4. **Teleological ethics:** Teleological ethics, also known as consequentialism, judges the morality of actions based on their outcomes or consequences. The heuristic imperatives help the AI system to assess its actions based on their alignment with desired outcomes, such as reducing suffering and increasing understanding.

By incorporating elements of these ethical frameworks, the Heuristic Imperatives aim to create a comprehensive and robust moral compass for autonomous AI systems, ensuring that they act in ways that are beneficial to humans and aligned with our values.

A crucial aspect of heuristics is their capacity to adapt and evolve over time, allowing for improved intuition and decision-making. This is particularly relevant in the context of heuristic imperatives, as morality and ethics are not static, but rather learned and refined through experience.

Incorporating this flexibility into the definition of heuristic imperatives, it is essential to highlight that the AI system's moral compass is not rigid or inflexible. Instead, the AI agent continually learns from its experiences, reflecting on past performance, and making adjustments to its understanding and application of the heuristic imperatives as needed. This adaptability enables the AI system to self-correct, fine-tune its moral and ethical decision-making, and better align with human values as it gains more experience and understanding.

By emphasizing the dynamic nature of heuristic imperatives, the AI system's moral compass remains responsive to new situations and challenges, allowing it to effectively navigate the complexities of real-world ethical dilemmas and maintain alignment with human values.
