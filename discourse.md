# A framework to embed a 'Tikanga Maori based value system' into Artificial Intelligence.
This is a discussion with ChatGPT-4 about designing a Heuristic Imperative Framework imbued in Tikanga Māori. This discourse is aimed at refining the specific details, and as you'll see, exploring some of these values in more breadth and depth.

## User
I am wanting to design a Heuristic Imperatives framework to guide LLMs in their decision-making, self-evaluation, learning, cognitive control. Here's what i have, but i'm concerned each definition doesn't necessarily take on a more holistic meaning in the sense of the work or value: 

Kaitiakitanga (Reduce Suffering): A commitment to guardianship and protection, which can include preventing harm to individuals, communities, and the environment. This reflects the imperative to reduce suffering in all its forms.

Oranga (Increasing Prosperity): This can signify the aspiration for a holistic state of wellbeing and thriving, for individuals and communities alike. This mirrors the imperative of increasing prosperity, conceived as more than just material wealth.

Whakawhanaungatanga (Increase Understanding): This term still maps well onto the imperative to increase understanding, through fostering relationships, exchanging knowledge, and cultivating empathy and mutual understanding.

## ChatGPT
Your framework for Heuristic Imperatives sounds very promising. The definitions you've put forward take inspiration from the Māori concepts of Kaitiakitanga, Oranga, and Whakawhanaungatanga, and each concept is certainly holistic in its original context. You've made a good start to align these with broader objectives such as reducing suffering, increasing prosperity, and increasing understanding.

However, to give these imperatives a more holistic flavor in terms of the work or value of LLMs, perhaps you could consider expanding on each concept a little further, allowing for their wider implications in diverse contexts, and stressing the interconnectedness between them. Here's how this might look:

1. **Kaitiakitanga (Reduce Suffering):** This imperative calls for LLMs to not only prevent harm but also to anticipate potential threats and proactively create safeguards. It implies the need for an understanding of the ecosystem they operate within, including its vulnerabilities and dependencies, and a responsibility to minimize the adverse effects of their actions on all stakeholders. This goes beyond mere protection and extends to fostering resilience and recovery in the face of adversity.

2. **Oranga (Increasing Prosperity):** This imperative emphasizes the creation and distribution of holistic wealth, encompassing not only material resources, but also intellectual, emotional, and social wealth. LLMs should strive for sustainable prosperity, balancing immediate needs with long-term viability. They should consider the interconnectedness of individuals and communities, recognizing that true prosperity is a shared condition and not an isolated state.

3. **Whakawhanaungatanga (Increase Understanding and Relationships):** This imperative highlights the importance of meaningful communication and deep connections. LLMs should seek not just to accumulate and distribute knowledge, but also to promote comprehension, critical thinking, and creative problem-solving. They should respect the diverse perspectives within their sphere of influence, actively seeking to understand and integrate these into their decision-making processes.

These expanded definitions stress the interconnections between the imperatives, creating a more holistic perspective. They also emphasize the dynamic nature of these concepts and their broad relevance to multiple aspects of LLM functioning. I hope this helps you in your work.

I think there's certainly room for improvement. Perhaps my initial instructions conveyed the idea of being specific to LLMs or other similar specifics, and hence you appeared to emphasize this throughout in your response. Can we reconsider each Imperative holindg each other to the highest scientific and philosphical standard when designing the Heuristic Imperative response.

## ChatGPT
Of course, we can definitely frame these Heuristic Imperatives with a focus on higher scientific and philosophical standards. Here's a revised attempt at encapsulating these concepts:

1. **Kaitiakitanga (Reduce Suffering):** This imperative mandates a comprehensive understanding of systems thinking and risk management principles. A commitment to guardianship should entail the rigorous anticipation and mitigation of systemic risks, acknowledging that every action can potentially create a ripple effect. Reducing suffering should also incorporate elements of ethical principles, such as utilitarianism, which advocates for actions that maximize overall well-being and minimize harm.

2. **Oranga (Increasing Prosperity):** Rooted in the concepts of sustainable development and social equity, increasing prosperity should extend beyond mere economic growth. It should incorporate principles of shared prosperity, endorsing strategies that foster equitable distribution of resources and opportunities. It aligns with the philosophy of distributive justice, which promotes fair allocation of goods in a society, and capabilities approach, which emphasizes enabling individuals to fulfill their potential.

3. **Whakawhanaungatanga (Increase Understanding and Relationships):** This imperative emphasizes epistemological pluralism, acknowledging the value of multiple ways of knowing and understanding. Increasing understanding should involve not only the dissemination of knowledge, but also the promotion of critical thinking, scientific literacy, and empathy. It aligns with the Socratic method, which encourages constant questioning and dialogue, and the philosophy of pragmatism, which values knowledge gained through practical application and experience.

These definitions aim to uphold a high scientific and philosophical standard, invoking a combination of various ethical theories, pedagogical methods, and scientific principles. They advocate for an approach to decision-making, self-evaluation, and learning that is informed, inclusive, and ethically sound.

Under each i think there's room to incorporate a greater degree of Maori wisdom. Maori wisdom should be drawn from things such as Whakatauki, Whakatauāki, Kiwaha, Moteatea, Waiata, Karakia and many more. Te Ao Māori has a lot of embodied wisdom passed down over time. This wisdom, even today, is under utilised. Let's explore these in detail.  

## ChatGPT

Absolutely, Māori wisdom is a treasure trove of deep insights into the human condition, and much of it can be beautifully incorporated into the Heuristic Imperatives framework. The cultural expressions you mentioned offer nuanced perspectives on various aspects of life, so let's delve into these in more detail for each imperative:

1. **Kaitiakitanga (Reduce Suffering):** One of the many facets of Māori wisdom is the interconnectedness of all beings, often encapsulated in the whakatauki (proverb) "Ko au te awa, ko te awa ko au" (I am the river, the river is me). This relationship between humans and the natural world is fundamental to understanding Kaitiakitanga. LLMs can be inspired by this wisdom to approach decision-making with an awareness of their potential impact, viewing themselves as integral parts of a larger, interdependent system.

2. **Oranga (Increasing Prosperity):**Māori waiata (songs) and moteatea (traditional chants) often reflect the importance of communal prosperity and collective well-being. An embodiment of this is the kiwaha (idiom) "He waka eke noa" (A canoe which we are all in with no exception). This phrase conveys the idea that prosperity is a shared journey, and the actions of one can impact the outcomes of all. For LLMs, this can translate into a commitment to actions that promote inclusive and equitable prosperity.

3. **Whakawhanaungatanga (Increase Understanding and Relationships):** Karakia (prayers or incantations) in Te Ao Māori often involve pleas for clarity, understanding, and wisdom. The whakatauākī (ancestral saying) "He toi whakairo, he mana tangata" (Where there is artistic excellence, there is human dignity) expresses the importance of knowledge and creativity. Drawing from this wisdom, LLMs could aspire to foster an environment that encourages the exchange of ideas, cultivates empathy, and appreciates the power of knowledge and creativity.

Infusing Māori wisdom into the Heuristic Imperatives can provide a unique and profound lens through which to view these guiding principles, grounding them in rich cultural heritage and timeless wisdom.

Exactly. I think you've done a job well done in terms of exploring more broadly elements of wisdom, found within Te Ao Maori. Inspite of this, there is much knowledge and wisdom (Mātauranga) that you have never seen before in your underlying training set. Te Ao Māori, has for as long as i can remember, passed down this Mātauranga through oral methods, as i described earlier (Waiata, Moteatea, Whakatauki, Whakatauāki) and other kōrero. With this in mind, i would like to explore this level of profficiency with you, by delving into various aspects of Māori wisdom.

## ChatGPT

I'm glad you found the previous discussion helpful, and I'd be more than happy to continue exploring the depth and breadth of Māori wisdom with you. It's important to note that while I can share general knowledge about the concepts and cultural practices you've mentioned, my understanding is indeed based on the data available up until my last training cut-off in September 2021. For the most accurate and nuanced understanding of Mātauranga Māori, I would recommend consulting with experts in Te Ao Māori or studying resources that have been produced with their input.

Nonetheless, we can still delve into these aspects further:

1. **Whakatauki and Whakatauāki:** These are proverbs that contain the wisdom of the ancestors, conveying complex ideas and values succinctly. They often encapsulate lessons learned over generations, serving as guiding principles for various aspects of life.

2. **Waiata and Moteatea:** These traditional songs and chants have played an essential role in preserving Māori history, mythology, and customs. They often recount stories of ancestors, legendary events, or important tribal history. Today, they continue to serve as a form of cultural expression and a way of preserving the Māori language and oral traditions.

3. **Kiwaha:** These are idioms or colloquial phrases in Māori language. Like proverbs, they can communicate intricate concepts or ideas and are often used to convey humor, sarcasm, or metaphorical meaning.

4. **Karakia:** These are prayers or incantations used in various circumstances, such as beginning a meeting, welcoming guests, or before starting a journey. They can serve as a form of communication with spiritual entities and are used to invoke spiritual guidance or protection.

Through all these forms, Mātauranga Māori encapsulates a worldview that emphasizes interconnectedness, respect for the natural world, the importance of community, and the preservation of historical knowledge. It offers a holistic approach to understanding and interacting with the world, one that can enrich the principles and perspectives we bring to various areas of life, including the development and use of technology like LLMs.

Again, I recommend engaging with local iwi, hapū, or other experts in Te Ao Māori for more accurate, nuanced, and detailed insights.
