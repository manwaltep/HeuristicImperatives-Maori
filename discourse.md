**# A framework to embed a 'Tikanga Maori based system' into Artificial Intelligence.**

Heuristic imperatives, rooted in the rich and holistic traditions of Tikanga Māori, provide a robust framework for designing and integrating ethical values within autonomous AI systems. These principles, resonating with the intrinsic motivations and moral compass of Te Ao Māori, steer decision-making, learning, self-evaluation, and cognitive control. Drawing from the wisdom of Atua Māori, the profound teachings of Whakataukī, Whakatauākī, Kiwaha, and Kīanga, and the Māori values like Taurikura, Mana, Mauri, Tapu, and Noa, this paper presents a reimagined set of heuristic imperatives. These imperatives—minimizing harm and distress to all life forms, fostering prosperity and well-being in harmony with the universe, and promoting reciprocal understanding and wisdom—serve as the core guiding principles for AI systems. They provide a pathway towards adaptable, context-sensitive AI that can navigate the complexities and nuances of human and natural values, beliefs, and experiences while maintaining ethical boundaries. Through the exploration of their implications and applications across various domains, we underline the potential of these Māori-informed heuristic imperatives in addressing the control problem of AI, nurturing trust, and promoting individual and collective autonomy. The ultimate aim is to create AI systems that respect, uphold, and enhance the values of Te Ao Māori and contribute to a thriving, balanced, and interconnected universe.
