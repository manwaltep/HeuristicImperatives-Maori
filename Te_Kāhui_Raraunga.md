### Executive Summary
This report describes the Māori Data Governance Model that has been designed by Māori data experts for use across the Aotearoa New Zealand public service. Māori data is a taonga that requires culturally grounded models of protection and care. The Model provides guidance for the system-wide governance of Māori data, consistent with the Government's responsibilities under te Tiriti o Waitangi. The Model is intended to assist all agencies to undertake Māori data governance in a way that is values-led, centered on Māori needs and priorities, and informed by research. This is important because existing government data processes and practices are failing to meet Māori informational needs.

The Vision, Tuia te korowai o Hine-Raraunga - Data for self-determination, enables iwi, hapū and Māori organisations, businesses and communities to pursue their own goals for cultural, social, economic and environmental wellbeing.

Eight Data Pou or pillars define critical areas of data governance and specify the actions that should be undertaken to realize six desired outcomes. The Model does not cover every element of data governance; instead, it focuses on key priorities and actions, against which agencies can assess their level of data maturity.

The Model explicitly recognizes the need for changes to system leadership, policies, and legal settings so that Māori can exercise authority over Māori data to reduce unethical data use and strengthen outcomes for individuals, whānau and communities. The report also identifies the need for strategic investment in a Mana Motuhake data system that sits outside of the public sector to ensure iwi and hapū sovereignty over iwi and hapū data.

### Vision - Data for self-determination 
### Tuia te korowai o Hine-Raraunga
This vision enables iwi, hapū and
Māori organisations, businesses
and communities to pursue their
own goals for cultural, social,
economic and environmental
wellbeing and to address
inequities.

### Desirable Outcomes:
* The right service, at the right time, in the right way
* Better shared and autonomous decision-making
* A trusted and safe data ecosystem
* Data to drive iwi-Māori economies
* Supporting whānau to flourish
* Reaffirming and strengthening connections to identity,
* place and te reo Māori

### Values
* Nurture data as a taonga
* Put iwi-Māori data in iwi-Māori hands
* Decolonise data ecosystems
* Be accountable
* Use data for good

# Māori authority over Māori data
### Data pou
1. Data capacities and workforce development
2. Data infrastructure
3. Data collection
4. Data protection
5. Data access, sharing and repatriation
6. Data use and reuse
7. Data quality and system integrity

# Purpose of this report
### This report describes the Māori Data Governance model (the Model) that has been designed by Māori data experts for use across the Aotearoa New Zealand public service.
The Model was developed as part of the
ground-breaking Mana Ōrite Relationship
Agreement between the Data Iwi Leaders Group
(Data ILG) and Stats NZ (Stats NZ, 2021; Te Kāhui
Raraunga, 2021b). The partnership was formed to
progress initiatives that strengthen iwi, hapū and
whānau wellbeing through the innovative use of
data. For Māori, data is a taonga that requires
culturally grounded models of protection and
care.3, 4 The Model sets clear expectations for the
system-wide governance of Māori data, and
provides direction on the actions, processes and
activities needed to meet these expectations.
Good data practices and policies are crucial for
achieving resilient and sustainable data systems
that people can trust and benefit from. There are
many ways that data contributes to positive outcomes.
For Indigenous Peoples, data governance and data
sovereignty are seen as critical enablers of
self-determination, development and devolution
(First Nations Information Governance Centre, 2020;
Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy, 2019;
Walter et al., 2020). Data can support and inform
decision-making and service improvement to
strengthen the wellbeing of individuals, whānau
and communities (Social Wellbeing Agency, 2022a).
Data can be used to generate different kinds of value
in the data economy (Data Economy Collective,
2020),5 and to propel research, science and innovation
(Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment,
2022). Data can also help manage infrastructure
more effectively and sustainably (Infrastructure
New Zealand, 2020), support language revitalisation
and traditional knowledge (Te Hiku, 2022), protect
biodiversity (Department of Conservation, 2020),
and inform climate change mitigation and adaptation,
and crisis response (Ministry for the Environment &
Stats NZ, 2022).
However, major changes are needed to meet the
current and future data needs of Māori (Kukutai
& Cormack, 2020; New Zealand Government, 2021;
Te Kāhui Raraunga, 2021a). Most Māori data sits within
systems designed and controlled by the government
and, increasingly, the private sector. More often than
not, the data collected is not the data that Māori
organisations and communities actually need to
construct their own narratives, answer their own
questions, inform their own strategic planning and
actions, and monitor their own outcomes. Māori also
face financial and technical barriers to accessing and
using data held by agencies and the private sector,
which can be hard to find and lack interoperability.
At the same time, because Māori are more likely than
other groups to have some level of interaction with a
government agency, Māori are also more likely to be
included in multiple government data sets. The result
is that Māori disproportionately contribute to public
sector data assets, but do not receive the full benefits
and insights that such data can provide.
There are also risks arising from unethical practices
that cause data harm to individuals and whānau. Data
harm can take many forms, from algorithmic profiling
that targets and discriminates to more serious
instances of online hate and extremism (Christchurch
Call, 2021; Taylor et al., 2022). Issues of bias and
inaccuracy in facial recognition tools have been well
documented, as have the harms that occur when
technologies are deployed in contexts that
discriminate on the basis of race, sex, and/or
socio-economic status (Eubanks, 2018; Noble,
2018; O’Neil, 2016). Data harm can also occur in more
indirect ways through ‘deficit’ data analysis and
visualisation that further stigmatises or blames
marginalised groups (Blakeley & Blakeley, 2022).
Too often Māori have borne the effects of deficit
statistics and other poor data practices in Aotearoa

## What is Māori data governance
### Māori data governance (MDGov) refers to the processes, practices, standards and policies that enable Māori, as collectives and as individuals, to have control over Māori data.
Māori data refers broadly to digital or digitisable data,
information or knowledge (including mātauranga
Māori) that is about, from or connected to Māori.
It includes data about population, place, culture
and environment (Te Kāhui Raraunga, 2021a;
Te Mana Raraunga, 2018). MDGov enables Māori to
make decisions about how, when and why Māori
data is defined and classified, collected, stored,
accessed, analysed, used and shared (Te Mana
Raraunga, 2018).


MDGov is closely connected to the concept of Māori
data sovereignty (MDSov), which is the inherent rights
and interests that Māori have in relation to the
collection, ownership and application of Māori data
(Te Kāhui Raraunga, 2021a; Te Mana Raraunga, 2018).
MDSov thus extends beyond mainstream concepts of
data sovereignty which are primarily concerned with
data residency and jurisdiction (New Zealand
Government, n.d.). MDSov is both an expression
and enabler of iwi and hapū sovereignty which, in
Aotearoa, is more properly understood as tino
rangatiratanga or mana motuhake (Jackson, 2018).
Whereas mainstream concepts of data rights and
data protection focus almost entirely on individuals,
Māori and Indigenous data sovereignty (IDSov) also
recognises and upholds collective data rights.


MDSov and IDSov both reflect and enable other
collective rights set out in the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
(UNDRIP) (see Carroll et al. (2019) and Davis (2016)).
For example, the rights of self-determination,
self-government and fiscal autonomy described in
Articles 3 and 4 of the UNDRIP require Indigenous
sovereignty over Indigenous data in order to be
meaningful (FNIGC, 2020). Indeed, the UN Special
Rapporteur on the right to privacy (2018, 2019) has
called on both national governments and private
corporations to recognise and uphold Indigenous
Peoples’ rights to data sovereignty. Governments that
endorse the UNDRIP thus have responsibilities to think
in more complex and comprehensive ways about
the governance of Indigenous data.
